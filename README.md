<h1> MARIOFLOW </h2>
<hr>
<p> I am going to use Convolutional Neural Network to get the basic inputs for Mario in </p>
<h3> Super Mario Bros </h3> 
<p> As i have a limited computational power i would also update the model in such a way that it would have reward based learning later in the future<p>
<hr>
<h3>So Let me get Gaming for the data ..............</h3>
<ul>
<li><sub>I will be using a emulator and the my trusty old controller </sub>
<li><sub>And to store data i will use Opencv for the ongoing screen and i will use a python script to log the key strokes</sub>
</ul>
<center><sub><sub>****I wish this could be unsupervised*****</sub></sub></center>
